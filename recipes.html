        <p>Cobbler is my favorite dessert and I love it with all kinds of fruit. My dad usually makes this blackberry cobbler recipe from The Pioneer Woman (on Food Network), Ree Drummond. I love to eat it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.</p>

        <img src="images/chocolate_bundt_cake_whole.webp" width="400" alt="A photo of a chocolate bundt cake with chocolate chips, sprinkled with powdered sugar">


        <p>My mom has been making this cake ever since a neighbor introduced her to the recipe when I was a child. We lost the original recipe, but found this one that tastes the same. I ask my mom to make it every year for my birthday.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yellow cake mix</li>
            <li>Instant chocolate pudding mix</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Avocado oil 🥑</li>
            <li>Eggs 🥚</li>
            <li>Sour cream</li>
            <li>Semi-sweet chocolate chip morsels 🍪</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees farenheit.</li>
            <li>In a medium mixing bowl, combine the cake mix, pudding mix and sugar, using a whisk to break up any lumps.</li>
            <li>In a separate large mixing bowl, combine the water, oil, eggs and sour cream and mix on low for about a minute.</li>
            <li>Slowly incorporate the dry ingredients until they are combined, making sure not to over-mix.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Spray a bundt pan well with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Add batter, and bake at 350 until cooked through, about 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow cake to cool before removing from bundt pan. Place on a cake stand and use the surface to cover the top of the bundt pan (cake stand will be upside down to start) while carefully flipping it over to where the bundt opening is on bottom, right up next to the plate. Then, carefully lift off the bundt pan.</li>
            <li>Use a fine mesh strainer to sprinkle on powdered sugar for garnish. This helps it to sprinkle more evenly and pretty, plus it strains out any lumps.</li>
        </ol>
